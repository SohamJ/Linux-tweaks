1) CREATING BOOTABLE USB

Install/download unetbootin
Format pendrive of size atleast 2 gb to fat32
Download iso for the version you want
open unetbootin
select iso 
select drive as your pendrive
install OS on the pendrive

2) DUAL BOOT SYSTEM

Disable secure boot
Disable fastboot

3) CREATE A PARTITION

From windows, use the disk utility
Shrink an existing partition to the size you want ( think about swap space as well swap=Ramx1.5 if RAM>4 else swap = 2xRAM)

4) SETUP

Boot into the live usb
Select the option to try ubuntu before installing, just to see if it is installed correctly
Enter the setup, connect to wireless
Do NOT enable updates during setup, it increases setup time
Enable 3rd party codecs
On the screen asking you to install ubuntu alongside windows/over windows etc, choose something else (the last option)
You will see all your paritions in the table
Check the partition corresponding to the size you allocated previously
Delete the partition to get free space
