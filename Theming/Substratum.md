*This is not a objective 'guide' to theming, per se. I am a noob themer and some things in here may be incorrect or poorly explained. This is just my tryst with theming.*

*When I started with theming, I found no proper guide to understand what I was really doing. So this is my verbose description on how you can get started on making your own theme for Substratum*


The stuff I'll write is what I did on a Linux machine, Ubuntu 16.04 to be precise (good pun for ubuntu 12.04). You will find setup stuff in my [installation script](https://github.com/SohamJ/Linux-tweaks/blob/master/installation.sh ). You can check how to install Android Studio and SDK on Google's site.
